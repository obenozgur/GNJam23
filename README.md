## 4.Story, Setting and Character

### 4.1.Story and Narrative 
      Our poor doll is missing in a liminal back room where some walls are coming torward it. With no other choice, it made its way to the darkened door

### 4.2.Game World
      A dreamlike empty and silent back room with wired lights and unnatural vibe. It's obviously very creepy but it gives a strange sense of familiarity and nostalgia.

### 4.3.Characters.
      This wretched rag doll is like a personality projection of each of us in childhood. We cannot establish a direct dialogue with ourselves. We can only feel our inner self when facing something that tends to be intuitive, or even in a specific imprisoned situation. What we are really obsessed with is being able to truly feel The wonderful physical and mental feeling when you are inside and outside yourself is a sense of freedom under the shackles of imprisonment. We all expect a 'strange thing' or an 'unknown thing', and it has the image of a 'monster', but in fact, this 'monster' is precisely our inner self. This mirror that illuminates our inner self reflects our confusion, pain, happiness, sadness, and even death at a certain period. We linger in that barren land without any meaning in order to awaken And recalling the process of moving from confinement to freedom, what we yearn for is the moment of getting in touch with our hearts, and returning to a state similar to the mother's body.

## 5.Levels

The level will change and adjust when the body part of the doll is missed. If the doll has all body part, black area is around that size, similarly when doll has only three limb and a head, the black area will be smaller to be a challenge for three limbs.
